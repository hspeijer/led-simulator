# Cursor AI Rules for LED Simulator Project

## Development Server Management

**NEVER start or restart the development server** (`yarn dev`, `npm run dev`, `next dev`, etc.)
- The user will manage the dev server themselves
- Do not run commands like `yarn dev`, `npm start`, or any server-starting commands
- Do not run servers in the background
- If suggesting fixes that require a restart, inform the user to restart manually

## Allowed Commands

You MAY run:
- `yarn install` / `yarn add` - Installing dependencies
- `yarn build` - Building for production (to verify compilation)
- File operations (read, write, delete, etc.)
- Linting and type checking
- Git operations
- Testing commands

## Communication

When changes require a server restart:
- ✅ Say: "Please restart your dev server with `yarn dev`"
- ❌ Don't: Actually run `yarn dev` or restart the server

## Background Processes

- Never run commands with `is_background: true` for servers
- Never use `timeout` with server commands
- Never use `nohup`, `&`, or similar background execution for servers
